## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to set up receiver information every time?
**A:** No! You only set it up once during initial setup. After that, you can update it anytime via the Profile modal.

### Q: Can I change the receiver later?
**A:** Yes! Click the profile icon (👤) in the Dashboard header, then edit the receiver information.

### Q: What if I skip the receiver setup?
**A:** You can't skip it - it's required to create letters. The app will guide you through it on first login.

### Q: Can I have multiple receivers?
**A:** Currently, the app supports one receiver per sender account. To write to a different person, you would need to update the receiver information in your profile.
